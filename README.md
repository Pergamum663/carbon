### Localization




## FAQ

#### Why is X used in this recipe?
I try to stick to the vanilla factorio spirit, with a slight edge towards more realistic. For this mod:

- Graphite used for resistors, lubricant, refractory, batteries, gaskets, nuclear reactors, etc.
- Diamonds used for grinding grit, drilling, bearings, high-tech electronics, etc.
- Graphene used for high-tech circuits, armor, satellites, filters, batteries, etc.
- Fullerenes used for biological things and making nanotubes
- Nanotubes used as an advanced material for alternative recipes
- Carbon black used for plastics, as a conductor and as a pigment

**CAVEAT** This is still an alpha version. Large balance changes, breaking changes, and many others may happen until it is in beta. There may be deadlocks, I'll fix them as I find them. This is my most ambitious "resource" mod to date, so it may take a little time to settle. As always, feedback and suggestions are most welcome.

Adds elemental carbon items to the game, including flake graphite, graphite, diamonds, graphene, and optionally fullerenes, nanotubes, and carbon black. It also adds a crucible intermediate. 

If you enjoy vanilla Factorio, Krastorio 2, or Space Exploration, and would like to add a new resource, this mod might be what you're looking for. 

If you use this alongside the other [Very BZ mods](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzvery), the game will become quite a bit more complex. While still far less than Angelbob or Pyanodon, it's a big step up from vanilla.

If you want a vanilla-esque game with a just few tweaks, try with just this mod, or a simpler one like [Titanium](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bztitanium) or [Lead](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzlead).

### Details

Flake graphite is a mineable resource that is processed into graphite. Graphite can be used in certain recipes, and can be further processed into diamonds and graphene. Optionally (default on), graphite can be processed into fullerenes and then nanotubes. Also optionally (default off), carbon black is available as a byproduct of oil processing, used to make plastic.


Supported compatible mods:
- Space Exploration & AAI
- Krastorio 2 & Rich Rocks Requiem
- Several smaller mods like Deadlock Stacking, Deadlock Crating, mining drill mods, etc

Planned but not yet supported: RSO (see faq), Omnimatter, FE+, 5Dim's, Simple Compress, and much more.

Many other mods are compatible, but not yet fully supported. Compatibility suggestions always appreciated.
